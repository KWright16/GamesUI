# GamesUI

### Front End
GamesUI is the front end for the GamesAPI built with React using Visual Studio.

### Back End
The back end was built using Asp.Net Core and utilises an SQL database. End points are provided for get, post, put and delete requests.

## Running Locally
To run the app locally using Visual Studio you will need the npm task runner extension and node installed on your computer. Once downloaded, in the task runner explorer double click the start script. You will also need to run the Games API locally before starting the project, see below. This runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Please note, for best results use Microsoft Edge for the browser. Some functionality is currently not supported in Chrome and Firefox.

## Using the App
The Games UI allows users to view games in the archive, select a game to view more details and update those details. The game can also be deleted from the game page. In addition to this the app has functionality to add a new game featuring form validation.

## Running the API
You will need to have the GamesAPI running locally before you can start the project. The back end API is available at https://github.com/KWright16/GamesAPI
